# Deploying a `json-server` app to Heroku



<br>



## `json-server` package


To speed up the initial development of the web apps and creation of the initial MVP, developers sometimes use packages/libraries that enable easy creation of API's without the need to code the entire server structure.

One of such tools is a `npm` package called [`json-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).

[`json-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) is a package that can be easily installed and run on the cloud hosting solution and it only requires a properly formated `.json` file.

## Getting started



<br>



This repository includes the complete setup needed for deploying a `json-server` app to Heroku.

Steps:

1. [Fork and Clone the repository](#fork-and-clone)
2. [Add the custom `db.json` file](#add-custom-db-json)
3. [Deploy to Heroku](#deploy-to-heroku)

###  Fork and clone the repository 



Before adding a custom `db.json` file you should **Fork** this repo to your user account. 

Once done **Clone** that repo to your local machine by using the link from your own repository.

### Add the custom `db.json` file



#### `db.json` file

`db.json` file being loaded as a mock database.

Once run, `json-server` loads the provided file `db.json`, and uses the first level property names of the object as the server endpoints.



<br>



`json-server` will make these first level properties into server endpoints `domain.com/posts`, `domain.com/comments`, `domain.com/profile` .



<br>



Give it a try with the deployed server example. 

The below url's belong to the server deployed with the example code in this repo, using the `db.json` file that you will find in this repo.



 Open the below links in your browser or make `GET` request using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), to see how `db.json` is transformed into server endpoints:

#### Creating custom endpoints

In order to create custom endpoints on your server, you need to include them in the `db.json` file.



You can replace the existing `db.json` file with your own file in order to get custom endpoints and data that will be served. 

Only rule that should be observed is that file must be named `db.json` and be placed in the root directory of the project, as it is in this starter code example.

### Deploy `json-server` to Heroku



##### Sign up for Heroku

If you don't have a Heroku account you should [Sign up / create Heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/). 



<br>

##### Install the Heroku CLI

Check if you have the Heroku CLI installed.

To [verify your Heroku CLI installation](), use the `heroku --version` command:



```bash
heroku --version

# If already installed you should get something like this:
heroku/7.0.0 (darwin-x64) node-v8.0.0 
```



<br>



##### Login to Heroku

After you ensure that Heroku CLI is installed, run the `heroku login` command. 

Youâ€™ll be prompted to enter any key to go to your web browser to complete login. The CLI will then log you in automatically.

```bash
heroku login
```



<br>



##### Create a new Heroku app

To create a new Heroku app/project run the command (in order for your app to have a custom name, change the `name-of-your-server-app` part to include name that you want):

```bash
heroku create name-of-your-server-app
```
